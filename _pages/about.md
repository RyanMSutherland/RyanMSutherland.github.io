Hi everyone! My name is Ryan Sutherland and I am a PhD Student at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. My research interests are currently in the space of Human Robot Interaction and understanding how humans and robots can most effectively communicate with one another in shared spaces. 

I am originally from Toronto, Canada where I grew up enjoying just about every sport including Baseball, Hockey, Squash and Soccer in addition to travelling and spending time with my dogs. Through my travels, I have been able to live in a number of places including Vancouver BC, Orlando FL, and Paris France!
